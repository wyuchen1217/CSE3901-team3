## How to play this game
* This game has 81 game cards. 
* Each card has 1 of 3 colors (green, purple, red), 1 of 3 numbers (1-shape, 2-shapes, 3-shapes), 1 of 3 shadings (filled-in, outlined, shaded), 1 of 3 symbols (ovals, squiggles, diamonds).
* One point is earned for each set that is identified. One point is lost if a player guesses an incorrect set or incorrectly guesses that there are no sets.
* A set is a group of three cards in which they all have the same or different value for each attribute.
* An example of a set includes the following cards: One green striped squiggle, one red solid squiggle, one purple open squiggle.
* Players take turns entering set guesses.
* The game ends when the timer runs out.
* The player with the highest total score wins!
